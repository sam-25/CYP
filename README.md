Crop Yield Prediction

Using the Final.ipynb file, we can predict the yield at a particular region. Required inputs are: State, District, Year, Season, Crop and Area. So, we can find the yield of each crop and chose the crop with maximum yield.

The crop_prediction.csv file is used for training various ML models like linear regression, Decision Tree, Ridge Regression, etc.
